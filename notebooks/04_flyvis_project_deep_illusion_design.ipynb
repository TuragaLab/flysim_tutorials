        "# Project 2: Deep illusion design - creating stimuli that fool neural networks\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project explores how to create visual illusions that exploit specific computational mechanisms in neural networks. You will design stimuli that appear to have certain properties (e.g., looming motion) but are not recognized as such by the trained networks, revealing insights about their internal representations and failure modes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mathematical foundation\n",
        "\n",
        "### The illusion design problem\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to create a stimulus S that:\n",
        "1. **Appears** to have property P to a human observer or ground-truth detector\n",
        "2. **Fails** to be recognized as having property P by our neural networks\n",

        "For texture-based illusions, we modify the background texture while preserving motion cues:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$S(x,y,t) = \\\\text{Motion}(x,y,t) + \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\text{Texture}(x,y,t)$$\n",
