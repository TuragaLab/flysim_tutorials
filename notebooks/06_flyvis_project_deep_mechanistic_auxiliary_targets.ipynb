        "# Project Idea 3: Deep mechanistic auxiliary targets\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project overview\n",
        "\n",
        "**Goal**: Develop auxiliary training targets to train properties such as mean, variance and coarse dynamic behavior of the cell type activity without task-training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background**:  \n",
        "Task-training alone does not guarantee that each model cell responds to a broad set of naturalistic stimuli, whereas biological neurons likely would.  \n",
        "Moreover, responses across cell types in the model can in principle reach arbitrary scales and misalign in their steady-state values, which is biologically implausible.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Guiding questions**:\n",
        "- What are responses across cell types to grey screen like?\n",
        "- What are responses across cell types to other simple stimuli like?\n",
        "- What could be auxiliary targets for the cell type responses in the network to control such behavior?\n",
        "- How to conceptualize an auxiliary target based on, for instance, information rate transfer (see refs below)?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "By completing this project, you will:\n",
        "- Understand the high-level behavior of trained networks\n",
        "- Develop your own training target to train network to your own mechanistic requirements\n",
        "- Implement your objective function and train the network without task training\n",
        "- Analyse the network mechanisms resulting from your auxiliary target\n",
