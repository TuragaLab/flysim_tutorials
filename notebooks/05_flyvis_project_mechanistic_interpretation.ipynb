        "# Project 3: Mechanistic interpretation through advanced clustering and analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project focuses on advanced mechanistic interpretation of neural network ensembles. You will learn to perform multi-cell-type clustering, analyze cross-layer correlations, and develop computational hypotheses about how different network instances solve the same task through different mechanistic strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mathematical foundation\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-cell-type embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of analyzing single cell types, we create joint embeddings across multiple cell types. Given responses $R^{(k)}$ for cell type k, we construct a concatenated representation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$X_i = [R_i^{(1)}, R_i^{(2)}, \\\\ldots, R_i^{(K)}]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $X_i$ represents the full response profile of network i across K cell types.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Canonical correlation analysis (CCA)\n",
        "\n",
        "To understand relationships between cell types, we use CCA to find linear combinations that maximize correlation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\\\max_{a,b} \\\\text{corr}(a^T R^{(1)}, b^T R^{(2)})$$\n",
        "\n",
        "subject to $||a|| = ||b|| = 1$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Information-theoretic measures\n",
        "\n",
        "We quantify information flow between cell types using mutual information:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$I(R^{(i)}, R^{(j)}) = \\\\sum_{r_1, r_2} p(r_1, r_2) \\\\log \\\\frac{p(r_1, r_2)}{p(r_1)p(r_2)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hierarchical clustering with custom metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "We define task-relevant distance metrics for clustering:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$d_{task}(i,j) = \\\\alpha \\\\cdot d_{response}(i,j) + \\\\beta \\\\cdot d_{performance}(i,j) + \\\\gamma \\\\cdot d_{connectivity}(i,j)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- $d_{response}(i,j)$ measures response similarity\n",
        "- $d_{performance}(i,j)$ measures task performance similarity  \n",
        "- $d_{connectivity}(i,j)$ measures network connectivity similarity\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mechanistic hypothesis testing\n",
        "\n",
        "For each discovered cluster, we test mechanistic hypotheses using lesioning experiments:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$H_k: \\\\text{Cluster k uses mechanism M}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "We test this by:\n",
        "1. Identifying critical nodes/connections for mechanism M\n",
        "2. Lesioning these components\n",
        "3. Measuring performance degradation\n",
        "4. Comparing across clusters\n",
        "\n",
        "### Graph-theoretic analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "We analyze network connectivity patterns using graph measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_i = \\\\frac{\\\\text{number of triangles involving node i}}{\\\\text{number of possible triangles involving node i}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$B_i = \\\\sum_{s \\\\neq t} \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{st}(i)}{\\\\sigma_{st}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $C_i$ is the clustering coefficient and $B_i$ is the betweenness centrality.\n",

        "## Learning objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By completing this project, you will:\n",
        "- Master advanced clustering techniques for neural network analysis\n",
        "- Learn to analyze information flow and connectivity patterns\n",
        "- Develop and test mechanistic hypotheses about neural computation\n",
        "- Apply graph theory to understand network organization\n",
